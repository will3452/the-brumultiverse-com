            For interested authors and artists, please send sample materials – short stories or first three chapters of a manuscript you’re working on or your visual works of art – to submissions@brumultiverse.com, along with a brief introduction about you and your artistic life. We will get back to you as soon as we can.
        Please note, however, that while we recognize your awesome works and ideas, we only publish stories set within the BRUMULTIVERSE.
